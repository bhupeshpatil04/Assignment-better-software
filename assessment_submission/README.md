Assessment Submission - Flask + React (Comments CRUD)

Structure:
- backend/   -> Flask app with comments CRUD and pytest tests
- frontend/  -> Minimal React UI component to add/delete comments
- walkthrough.txt -> script for your PR video walkthrough

Zip includes runnable backend tests. Frontend is minimal and intended as bonus.

To run backend tests:
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest -q
